## Features

-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for responsive and customizable styling.
-   **Dynamic Components**: Modular structure with reusable components such as `Navbar`, `Hero`, `About`, `Testimonial`, and `Footer`.
-   **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with smooth transitions and animations.
-   **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing state and interactivity.
-   **Dynamic Testimonials**: Client data (images, names, reviews) rendered dynamically using a `clients` array.
